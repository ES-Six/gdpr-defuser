# gdpr-defuser
This repository provides some UBlock origin filters to automatically not accept (by technically hiding without accepting it) GDPR policy popups, messages and other annoying stuff.

Are you tired of those RGPD popups? I am too.

# How to install ?

In the uBlock origin Filter tab simply copy this url in the import field to automatically import and sync the GDPR defuser rulesets to uBlock :

URL : `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ES-Six/gdpr-defuser/main/ruleset.txt`
